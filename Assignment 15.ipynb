    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans. A database is a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases \n",
    "are used to store and manage data in a structured way, making it easy to search, sort, and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL. SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational\n",
    "databases that use a predefined schema to structure data. They use tables with rows and columns to store data,\n",
    "and use SQL queries to manipulate the data. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that don not use a predefined schema. Instead,\n",
    "they use a flexible data model that can be easily adapted to changing data requirements. NoSQL databases can\n",
    "store data in various formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, and graphs. They are designed to handle large\n",
    "amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data and can scale horizontally. Examples of NoSQL databases include \n",
    "MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the project. SQL databases are often \n",
    "used for transactional systems, such as e-commerce or banking applications, where data integrity and consistency are critical. NoSQL databases,\n",
    "on the other hand, are often used for big data applications, real-time analytics, or applications with constantly changing data requirements."

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "Ans. DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL used to define and modify the structure of\n",
    "a database. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of commonly used DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create a new database object such as a table, view, index, or stored procedure. \n",
    "For example, the following SQL statement creates a new table named \"customers\":\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
    "  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  email VARCHAR(100)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "2. This statement creates a table with three columns: id, name, and email. The id column is defined as the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP: The DROP statement is used to delete an existing database object such as a table or view. For example,\n",
    "the following SQL statement drops the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "This statement deletes the \"customers\" table from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. \n",
    "For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column named \"phone\" to the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers\n",
    "ADD phone VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "This statement modifies the \"customers\" table by adding a new column called \"phone\" of type VARCHAR(20).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table. Unlike the DROP statement, \n",
    "TRUNCATE preserves the structure of the table. For example, the following SQL statement removes all rows from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n",
    "This statement deletes all rows from the \"customers\" table, but leaves the table structure intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DDL statements such as CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used to create, modify, and delete database objects \n",
    "such as tables, views, and indexes. These statements allow database administrators and \n",
    "developers to manage the structure of a database and to control access to the data."

    "Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "Ans. DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a subset of SQL used to manipulate data within a database. \n",
    "DML statements are used to insert, update, and delete data from database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of commonly used DML statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT: The INSERT statement is used to add new rows to a table. For example, the following SQL statement inserts a \n",
    "new record into the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "    \n",
    "INSERT INTO customers (name, email, phone)\n",
    "VALUES ('John Smith', 'john@example.com', '555-1234');\n",
    "This statement inserts a new row into the \"customers\" table with the specified values for the \"name\", \"email\", and \"phone\" columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table. For example, the following SQL statement updates\n",
    "the phone number of the customer with the ID of 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE customers\n",
    "SET phone = '555-5678'\n",
    "WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "This statement modifies the \"phone\" column of the \"customers\" table for the row where the \"id\" column is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE: The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows from a table. For example, the following SQL statement deletes \n",
    "the customer with the ID of 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE FROM customers\n",
    "WHERE id = 2;\n",
    "This statement removes the row from the \"customers\" table where the \"id\" column is equal to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DML statements such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are used to manipulate data within a database. These statements \n",
    "allow database administrators and developers to add, modify, and delete data in tables to ensure that the data in the database \n",
    "remains accurate and up-to-date."

    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "Ans. DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of SQL used to retrieve data from a database. DQL statements\n",
    "are used to query one or more tables and retrieve the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used DQL statement is SELECT, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.\n",

    "\n",
    "column1, column2, ...: This specifies the columns that you want to retrieve data from. You can specify one or more columns, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "table_name: This specifies the name of the table that you want to retrieve data from.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHERE condition: This specifies the condition that the rows must meet to be included in the results. You can use operators \n",
    "such as \"=\", \"<\", \">\", \"<=\", \">=\", and \"<>\" to compare values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use the SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT name, email, phone\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "Ans. Primary Key and Foreign Key are two important concepts in relational databases that help establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table.\n",
    "It serves as the unique identifier for each record in the table and ensures that there are no duplicate \n",
    "values in the table. A primary key can be created when a \n",
    "table is created or added to an existing table. Primary keys are often used as the basis for relationships between tables.\n",
    "Some examples of primary keys include Social Security Numbers, email addresses, and customer IDs.\n",
    "For example, consider a table called \"customers\" that has the following columns: \"customer_id\", \"name\", \"email\", and \"phone\". \n",
    "The \"customer_id\" column can be defined as the primary key for this table, as it uniquely identifies each customer in the table. \n",
    "This ensures that there are no duplicate customer records in the table.\n",
    "2. Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table.\n",
    "It establishes a relationship between two tables based on a common column. The foreign key is used to ensure\n",
    "referential integrity between the tables. It ensures that data entered in one table matches data in another table.\n",
    "For example, consider a table called \"orders\" that has the following columns: \"order_id\", \"customer_id\", \"order_date\",\n",
    "and \"total_amount\". The \"customer_id\" column can be defined as a foreign key for this table because it references the \n",
    "\"customer_id\" column in the \"customers\" table. This establishes a relationship between the \"orders\" table and the \n",
    "\"customers\" table, and ensures that each order is associated with a valid customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key is used to uniquely identify each record in a table, while a foreign key is used to establish\n",
    "a relationship between two tables based on a common column. Primary and foreign keys are important for maintaining data\n",
    "integrity and ensuring that data is stored and accessed correctly in a relational database."

    "FROM: This clause specifies the table or tables from which the data will be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "JOIN: If the query involves multiple tables, the JOIN clause is used to join the tables based on a common column.\n",

    "\n",
    "HAVING: The HAVING clause is used to filter the groups that meet a specified condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: The SELECT clause is used to select the columns that will be included in the result set.\n",

    "DISTINCT: The DISTINCT clause is used to remove duplicate rows from the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set by one or more columns.\n",

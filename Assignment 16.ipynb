    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use \n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Ans. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that is designed to store and manage large \n",
    "volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, and provides a rich \n",
    "set of features for querying and indexing that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional tabular \n",
    "schema used in relational databases. Instead, NoSQL databases use various data models such as document-oriented, \n",
    "key-value, graph, and column-family to store and manage data. NoSQL databases are often used in scenarios where\n",
    "the data is unstructured, constantly changing, or where the database needs to scale horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is unstructured or semi-structured.\n",
    "For example, if you are building a web application that requires the storage of large amounts of data such as\n",
    "images, videos, or user-generated content, MongoDB's flexible document-based data model can be more suitable\n",
    "than a traditional SQL database. MongoDB's ability to scale horizontally and its support for sharding and\n",
    "replication also make it a good choice for applications that require high availability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, MongoDB's flexible schema and ability to store nested and hierarchical data can make it easier to work\n",
    "with data that has a complex structure, such as social media feeds, e-commerce transactions, or IoT data. MongoDB also\n",
    "supports geospatial data and has built-in support for text search, making it a good choice for applications that require \n",
    "location-based or full-text search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",

    "the data is unstructured or semi-structured, requires high scalability and performance, and has complex structures or requires \n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that is designed to store and manage large volumes\n",
    "of unstructured or semi-structured data. Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-oriented data model: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents that can have nested data structures.\n",
    "This allows for more natural and efficient representation of complex data compared to traditional tabular schema used in relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic schema: MongoDB has a flexible schema that allows for easy modification of data structures, without the need for \n",
    "predefined tables or fields. This makes it easier to handle changing data requirements in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal scaling: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding and replication, allowing for the distribution of\n",
    "data across multiple servers or nodes. This allows for better performance and scalability compared to traditional SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB provides extensive indexing support, including compound indexes, geospatial indexes, and full-text search indexes.\n",
    "This enables faster query execution and better search performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation framework: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex queries, grouping, and transformations of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce: MongoDB supports MapReduce for performing distributed computations on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich query language: MongoDB supports a rich query language that includes support for filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID transactions: MongoDB supports ACID transactions, providing the ability to execute multiple operations as a single atomic transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enterprise-grade security: MongoDB provides enterprise-grade security features, including access controls, authentication, and\n",
    "encryption at rest and in transit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MongoDB is a feature-rich NoSQL document-oriented database that provides a dynamic schema, horizontal scaling, indexing,\n",
    "powerful aggregation and query capabilities, and enterprise-grade security features. These features make it a popular choice for\n",
    "applications that require high scalability, performance,\n",
    "and flexibility in handling unstructured or semi-structured data."

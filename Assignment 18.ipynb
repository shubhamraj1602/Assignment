    "Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "Ans. Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, \n",
    "while still providing the flexibility and extensibility needed to build complex web applications. Flask is\n",
    "often used to build small to medium-sized web applications, RESTful APIs, and other web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of using Flask Framework include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework, which means it has a small codebase and minimal dependencies. This\n",
    "makes it easy to install and maintain, and it can run on a wide range of systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask allows developers to build web applications and services with a lot of flexibility. It is designed \n",
    "to be modular, which means you can easily add or remove features as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to learn: Flask is relatively easy to learn compared to other web frameworks. It has a simple and intuitive API,\n",
    "and the documentation is extensive and easy to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: Flask can be extended with a wide range of plugins and extensions, which can add new functionality and improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing: Flask provides a simple and easy-to-use testing framework, which allows developers to test their code and ensure \n",
    "that it is working as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large community: Flask has a large and active community of developers, which means there are plenty of resources available \n",
    "for learning and troubleshooting."

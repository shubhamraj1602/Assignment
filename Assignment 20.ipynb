    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "Ans. There are several methods used for web scraping, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing HTML: One of the most common methods for web scraping is to parse the HTML code of a web page using a web scraping library like\n",
    "BeautifulSoup or Scrapy. The scraper extracts the desired data by navigating the HTML code tree and identifying specific elements\n",
    "and attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using APIs: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access data programmatically.\n",
    "APIs provide a more structured and organized way of accessing data than parsing HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using browser extensions: Browser extensions like Web Scraper and Data Miner allow users to extract data from web pages by visually\n",
    "selecting and highlighting the desired data elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated browsing: Tools like Selenium and Puppeteer can be used to automate web browsing and extract data from web pages. These \n",
    "tools simulate user interaction with web pages and can extract data from dynamic and JavaScript-heavy sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text pattern matching: Regular expressions or regex can be used to extract data from web pages based on specific text patterns,\n",
    "such as email addresses or phone numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning: Machine learning algorithms can be trained to extract data from web pages based on patterns and features\n",
    "in the data. This method requires a significant amount of data and training, but it can be useful for extracting data from\n",
    "unstructured and diverse sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that while web scraping is legal, it can sometimes raise ethical and legal concerns, especially when \n",
    "scraping personal data or copyrighted content. Therefore, it's important to always check the website's terms of service\n",
    "and respect their guidelines for data usage."

    "Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "Ans. Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for web scraping purposes. It provides a simple way to parse HTML and\n",
    "XML documents and extract useful information from them. Beautiful Soup is widely used because it is easy to learn and\n",
    "use, and it has many powerful features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the main reasons why Beautiful Soup is used for web scraping are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing HTML and XML: Beautiful Soup can parse HTML and XML documents and extract the data in a structured format. This\n",
    "makes it easy to extract data from web pages and analyze it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to use: Beautiful Soup has a simple and intuitive API, making it easy to use for developers of all levels of experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Powerful features: Beautiful Soup has many powerful features that make it easy to navigate HTML and XML documents, including\n",
    "search and filter functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compatible with multiple parsers: Beautiful Soup is compatible with multiple parsers, including lxml, html5lib, and html.parser,\n",
    "allowing developers to choose the parser that best suits their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust error handling: Beautiful Soup can handle poorly formatted HTML and XML documents and can still extract useful data from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Beautiful Soup is a powerful and flexible library for web scraping that can save developers a lot of time and effort when \n",
    "extracting data from web pages."

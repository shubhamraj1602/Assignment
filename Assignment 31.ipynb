    "Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\n",
    "Ans. Outliers are extreme values that are far from the other values in a dataset. Outliers can have a significant \n",
    "effect on measures of central tendency and dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of central tendency such as the mean and median are affected by outliers. Outliers can shift the mean in \n",
    "the direction of the outlier. For example, consider a dataset of test scores that includes an outlier score of 100.\n",
    "If the other scores in the dataset are in the range of 60-80, the outlier score of 100 will pull the mean upward,\n",
    "making it appear that the students in the group did better overall than they actually did. In contrast, the median \n",
    "is less affected by outliers because it is not influenced by extreme values in the same way as the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of dispersion such as the range and standard deviation can also be affected by outliers. The range, which is\n",
    "the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset, can be distorted by outliers if they are much higher\n",
    "or lower than the other\n",
    "values. For example, if we add an outlier value of 1000 to a dataset of salaries that range from 40,000 to 60,000, the \n",
    "range will be distorted and appear to be much larger than it actually is. Similarly, the standard deviation, which measures \n",
    "the amount of variability in a dataset, can be affected by outliers. Outliers can increase the standard deviation, making it appear \n",
    "that the dataset is more spread out than it actually is.\n",

    "In summary, outliers can have a significant effect on measures of central tendency and dispersion, and it is important to \n",

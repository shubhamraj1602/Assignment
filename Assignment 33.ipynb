    "Ans. The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are both ways of describing the probability\n",
    "distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value. For example,\n",
    "consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF of the outcome of rolling the die can be expressed as:\n",

    "It is a very common model for many natural phenomena, such as human height, weight, and intelligence, and can help us understand \n",

    "Ans. Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the outcomes of a single \n",

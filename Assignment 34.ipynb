    "Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "Ans. Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that involves estimating unknown parameters of a population \n",
    "based on sample data. It is used to make inferences about the population based on the characteristics of a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point estimate and interval estimate are two common approaches to estimation in statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Point Estimate: A point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate an unknown parameter of a population. \n",
    "It is calculated based on sample data and is used to estimate the value of the corresponding population parameter.\n",
    "For example, if we want to estimate the average height of all students in a university, we can take a sample of students\n",
    "and calculate the average height of those students. This average height is a point estimate of the population parameter.\n",
    "Interval Estimate: An interval estimate, on the other hand, is a range of values that is used to estimate an unknown population\n",
    "parameter. It is calculated based on sample data and takes into account the variability and uncertainty of the estimation process.\n",
    "An interval estimate is typically expressed in the form of a confidence interval, which provides a range of values within which the\n",
    "true population parameter is likely to lie. For example, if we want to estimate the average height of all students in a university,\n",
    "we can calculate a confidence interval based on a sample of students. This interval estimate provides a range of values within which\n",
    "the true population parameter is likely to lie with a certain level of confidence."

    "Q3: What is Hypothesis testing? Why is it used? State the importance of Hypothesis testing.\n",
    "Ans. Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or draw conclusions about a population based \n",
    "on sample data. It involves two hypotheses, the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis, which are both statements \n",
    "about the population parameter being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis typically states that there is no difference or no effect between the sample and the population, while\n",
    "the alternative hypothesis suggests otherwise. Hypothesis testing is used to determine the likelihood of observing a sample\n",
    "statistic if the null hypothesis is true, and to make a decision whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based \n",
    "on the level of significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of hypothesis testing lies in its ability to help us make decisions and draw conclusions based on data. By using\n",
    "hypothesis testing, we can determine the validity of assumptions, test the effectiveness of treatments or interventions, and\n",
    "make decisions about policies or procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a clinical trial, hypothesis testing can be used to determine whether a new drug is effective in treating a\n",
    "particular disease. The null hypothesis would be that the drug has no effect, while the alternative hypothesis would be that\n",
    "it does have an effect. By conducting the trial and analyzing the results, we can determine the probability of observing the\n",
    "results if the null hypothesis is true and decide whether to reject or fail to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, hypothesis testing is a powerful tool for making decisions and drawing conclusions based on data, and it is widely\n",
    "used in many fields such as science, medicine, economics, and psychology."

    "Q8. Define p-value and explain its significance in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "Ans. The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming \n",

    "result if the null hypothesis is actually true.\n",

    "The significance of the p-value lies in its use in hypothesis testing. After conducting a hypothesis test, if the p-value\n",

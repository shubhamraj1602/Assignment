    "Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would\n",
    "use each type of test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A t-test and a z-test are both statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample\n",
    "statistics, but they differ in the conditions under which they are applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A z-test is used when the sample size is large (usually n > 30), and the population standard deviation is known or can be\n",
    "assumed to be known. The test statistic is the z-score, which measures the number of standard deviations between the sample\n",
    "mean and the population mean. Z-tests are often used in quality control and manufacturing settings, where large sample sizes are common.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a shoe factory wants to test whether the mean length of a batch of shoes is equal to a target value of\n",
    "10 inches. The factory takes a random sample of 100 shoes and finds that the sample mean length is 10.2 inches, with a known \n",
    "population standard deviation of 0.5 inches. A z-test can be used to determine whether the sample mean length is significantly\n",
    "different from the target value of 10 inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a t-test is used when the sample size is small (usually n < 30) or when the population standard deviation is\n",
    "unknown. The test statistic is the t-score, which is calculated using the sample mean, the sample standard deviation, and the\n",
    "degrees of freedom (n-1). T-tests are commonly used in social sciences, psychology, and medicine, where sample sizes tend to be smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a researcher wants to test whether a new medication reduces blood pressure in patients. The researcher\n",
    "takes a random sample of 20 patients and measures their blood pressure before and after taking the medication. The difference\n",
    "between the two measurements is the sample mean, and the variability in the differences is the sample standard deviation. Since\n",
    "the population standard deviation is unknown, a t-test can be used to determine whether the mean difference in blood pressure is \n",
    "significantly different from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a z-test is used when the sample size is large and the population standard deviation is known or can be assumed to be\n",

    "Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.\n",
    "Ans. Bayes's theorem is a mathematical formula used in probability theory to calculate the probability of a \n",
    "hypothesis (or event) given the available evidence. The theorem is named after the 18th-century English mathematician\n",
    "and theologian, Thomas Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Bayes's theorem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E\n",
    "P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H\n",
    "P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H\n",
    "P(E) is the prior probability of the evidence E\n",
    "To understand Bayes's theorem, let's consider an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a woman wants to know the probability of having breast cancer given that she has a positive mammogram result. She \n",
    "consults a doctor who tells her that, in general, 1% of women over 50 have breast cancer. The mammogram is 90% accurate in \n",
    "detecting breast cancer in women who actually have it and also 90% accurate in giving a negative result in women who do not have cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes's theorem, we can calculate the probability of having breast cancer given a positive mammogram result as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let H be the hypothesis that the woman has breast cancer, and let E be the evidence of a positive mammogram result.\n",
    "P(H) = 0.01 (prior probability of having breast cancer)\n",
    "P(E|H) = 0.9 (probability of a positive mammogram given the woman has breast cancer)\n",
    "P(not H) = 0.99 (prior probability of not having breast cancer)\n",
    "P(E|not H) = 0.1 (probability of a positive mammogram given the woman does not have breast cancer)\n",
    "Using these values, we can calculate the probability of having breast cancer given a positive mammogram result as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]\n",
    "= 0.9 * 0.01 / [0.9 * 0.01 + 0.1 * 0.99]\n",
    "= 0.0833\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability of the woman having breast cancer given a positive mammogram result is about 8.33%. This means \n",
    "that even though she has a positive mammogram result, there is still a relatively low probability of her having breast cancer.\n",

    "In summary, Bayes's theorem is a powerful tool for updating the probability of a hypothesis or event based on new evidence or \n",

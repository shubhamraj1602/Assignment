    "Q1. Explain the assumptions required to use ANOVA and provide examples of violations that could impact\n",
    "the validity of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to compare the means of three or more groups. To use ANOVA, the following assumptions need to be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations within each group must be independent of each other.\n",
    "Normality: The data within each group must be normally distributed.\n",
    "Homogeneity of variance: The variance within each group must be equal.\n",
    "Violations of these assumptions can impact the validity of the ANOVA results. Here are some examples of violations and their \n",
    "impact on the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of independence: If the observations within each group are not independent, the variance estimate of the means will \n",
    "be too small, leading to an inflated F-value and a higher chance of a Type I error. For example, if data is collected from siblings, \n",
    "the independence assumption may be violated, and the ANOVA results may not be valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of normality: If the data within each group is not normally distributed, the ANOVA results may not be valid. Non-normal\n",
    "data may lead to skewed or misinterpreted results. For example, if the data has extreme outliers or is heavily skewed, the normality\n",
    "assumption may be violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of homogeneity of variance: If the variance within each group is not equal, the ANOVA results may not be valid. Unequal\n",
    "variances may lead to incorrect conclusions and affect the precision of the estimate. For example, if the variance in one group is \n",
    "much larger than in the other groups, the homogeneity of variance assumption may be violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to check for these assumptions before conducting ANOVA and to take steps to address violations if they are found. \n",
    "For example, if the normality assumption is violated, transformations such as log or square root transformations may be used to \n",
    "normalize the data. If the homogeneity of variance assumption is violated, alternative methods such as Welch's ANOVA or a non-parametric\n",
    "test may be used."

    "Q2. What are the three types of ANOVA, and in what situations would each be used?\n",
    "Ans. The three types of ANOVA are:\n",
    "\n",
    "One-way ANOVA: This type of ANOVA is used when there is one independent variable with three or more groups. It is used to \n",
    "test whether there are any significant differences between the means of the groups. One-way ANOVA is commonly used in experimental \n",
    "designs where one factor is manipulated to test its effect on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-way ANOVA: This type of ANOVA is used when there are two independent variables, each with two or more levels. It is used to test\n",
    "the main effects of each independent variable as well as their interaction effect on the dependent variable. Two-way ANOVA is commonly \n",
    "used in experimental designs to test the effects of two different factors on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed ANOVA: This type of ANOVA is used when there are two or more independent variables, with at least one being a within-subjects\n",
    "factor (i.e., measured on the same subjects under different conditions) and at least one being a between-subjects factor \n",
    "(i.e., measured on different subjects in different conditions). Mixed ANOVA is commonly used in research designs where both \n",
    "within-subject and between-subject factors are manipulated, such as in repeated measures experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, one-way ANOVA is used when there is one independent variable with three or more groups, two-way ANOVA is used when \n",

    "Q3. What is the partitioning of variance in ANOVA, and why is it important to understand this concept?\n",
    "Ans. Partitioning of variance in ANOVA refers to the division of the total variance in the data into different sources of variance, \n",
    "such as the variability within groups and the variability between groups. This division is essential because it allows us to\n",
    "understand the contributions of different sources of variance to the overall variance in the data and to determine whether\n",
    "any of the sources of variance are significant predictors of the outcome variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The partitioning of variance in ANOVA is done by decomposing the total sum of squares (SS) into two components: the sum of \n",
    "squares between groups (SSB) and the sum of squares within groups (SSW). The sum of squares between groups measures the variation \n",
    "in the outcome variable that can be attributed to differences between the groups being compared. The sum of squares within groups\n",
    "measures the variation in the outcome variable that cannot be explained by differences between the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio of the between-group variance to the within-group variance, known as the F-statistic, is used to test whether the means\n",
    "of the groups are significantly different from each other. If the F-statistic is large enough and the associated p-value is small\n",
    "enough, we can conclude that the groups are significantly different from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the concept of partitioning of variance in ANOVA is essential because it helps us determine whether the differences\n",
    "observed between groups are due to chance or whether they are statistically significant. By partitioning the variance into different\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans. In a repeated measures ANOVA, missing data can arise if some participants did not provide complete data for all time points\n",

    "Ans. Post-hoc tests are used in ANOVA to make pairwise comparisons between groups after a significant omnibus F-test. Some common \n",

    "Tukey's HSD test is often used when there are equal sample sizes in all groups, and it controls the family-wise error rate (FWER) \n",

    "Q12. A researcher wants to know if there are any significant differences in the average daily sales of three\n",
    "retail stores: Store A, Store B, and Store C. They randomly select 30 days and record the sales for each store\n",
    "on those days. Conduct a repeated measures ANOVA using Python to determine if there are any\n",

    "Ans. To conduct a repeated measures ANOVA using Python, we first need to import the necessary libraries and load the data. \n",
    "Let's assume that the data is stored in a CSV file named \"sales_data.csv\" and the columns are labeled \"Store\", \"Day\", and \"Sales\".\n",
    "Here's how we can perform the analysis:\n",

    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import statsmodels.api as sm\n",
    "from statsmodels.formula.api import ols\n",
    "\n",

    "data = pd.read_csv(\"sales_data.csv\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conduct the repeated measures ANOVA\n",
    "rm = ols(\"Sales ~ Store + Day + Store:Day\", data=data).fit()\n",
    "sm.stats.anova_lm(rm, typ=2)\n",
    "This code fits a repeated measures ANOVA model with \"Store\" and \"Day\" as the within-subjects factors, and their interaction term \"Store:Day\". The \"typ=2\" argument specifies a Type 2 ANOVA table, which is appropriate for unbalanced designs with missing data. The output should display the results of the ANOVA, including the F-statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the results of the ANOVA are significant, we can follow up with a post-hoc test to determine which store(s) differ significantly from each other. For example, let's say we want to use Tukey's HSD test:\n",
    "\n",
    "from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform Tukey's HSD test\n",
    "tukey = pairwise_tukeyhsd(endog=data[\"Sales\"], groups=data[\"Store\"], alpha=0.05)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the results\n",
    "print(tukey.summary())\n",
    "This code performs Tukey's HSD test on the \"Sales\" variable with the \"Store\" variable as the grouping factor. The \"alpha=0.05\" \n",
    "argument specifies the significance level. The output should display a table with the pairwise comparisons between stores, their\n",
    "differences in means, standard errors, confidence intervals, and p-values. We can use this table to determine which store(s) differ \n",
    "significantly from each other."

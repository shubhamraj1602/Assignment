    "Ans. Artificial Intelligence (AI): Artificial Intelligence is a broad field that involves creating intelligent machines\n",
    "that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and solving\n",
    "problems. AI systems can be designed to operate in a range of contexts, from simple rule-based systems to complex neural networks.\n",
    "Example: An example of AI in action is a virtual assistant like Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri. These assistants use natural\n",
    "language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand user requests and provide helpful responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML): Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building algorithms that can automatically learn\n",
    "from and improve based on data. Machine learning models are trained using large datasets, and the more data they have access \n",
    "to, the better they become at making accurate predictions or decisions.\n",
    "Example: An example of machine learning is an email spam filter. The filter is trained using a large dataset of emails that\n",
    "are either spam or not spam. As it processes new incoming emails, it uses patterns it learned from the training data to predict \n",
    "whether an email is likely to be spam or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves building complex neural networks with multiple\n",
    "layers. These networks are designed to learn and extract features from data, which can be used for a range of applications,\n",
    "such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.\n",
    "Example: An example of deep learning is image recognition. A deep learning model can be trained on a dataset of images,\n",

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "Ans. inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to be derived from an existing class, inheriting\n",
    "its attributes and behavior. This is useful for creating new classes that are related to existing classes and share some of their functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance\n",
    "Single inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from a single parent class, thus enabling code reusability and the addition\n",
    "of new features to existing code.\n",
    "#example\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def func1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This function is in parent class.\")\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def func2(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This function is in child class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "object = Child()\n",
    "object.func1()\n",
    "object.func2()\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "When a class can be derived from more than one base class this type of inheritance is called multiple inheritances.\n",
    "In multiple inheritances, all the features of the base classes are inherited into the derived class.\n",
    "class Mother:\n",
    "    mothername = \"\"\n",
    " \n",
    "    def mother(self):\n",
    "        print(self.mothername)\n",

    "s1.mothername = \"SITA\"\n",
    "s1.parents()\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Multilevel Inheritance :\n",
    "In multilevel inheritance, features of the base class and the derived class are further inherited into the new derived class.\n",
    "This is similar to a relationship representing a child and a grandfather.\n",

    "4. Hierarchical Inheritance:\n",
    "When more than one derived class are created from a single base this type of inheritance is called hierarchical inheritance. In this program, we have a\n",
    "parent (base) class and two child (derived) classes.\n",

    "Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new or unseen data.\n",
    "In other words, the model has fit the noise in the training data instead of the underlying pattern, leading to poor generalization. \n",
    "The consequences of overfitting include poor performance on new data, reduced model interpretability, and increased model complexity.\n",
    "On the other hand, underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data, resulting in poor\n",
    "performance on both the training and new data. The consequences of underfitting include high bias and low variance, leading\n",
    "to a lack of flexibility in the model.\n",

    "Q7: What is regularization in machine learning, and how can it be used to prevent overfitting? Describe\n",
    "some common regularization techniques and how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Regularization is a technique in machine learning that is used to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model \n",
    "learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to new, unseen data. Regularization achieves this by adding \n",
    "a penalty term to the loss function during training, which encourages the model to learn simpler, smoother functions \n",
    "that are less likely to overfit the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several common regularization techniques used in machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization (also known as Lasso regularization) adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the\n",
    "model parameters. This encourages the model to learn sparse, non-zero weights, effectively performing feature selection\n",
    "by eliminating irrelevant or redundant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization (also known as Ridge regularization) adds a penalty term proportional to the squared magnitude of the\n",
    "model parameters. This encourages the model to learn small, smooth weights, effectively shrinking the weights towards zero\n",
    "and reducing the impact of irrelevant or noisy features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout regularization randomly drops out a fraction of the neurons in a layer during training, effectively creating an\n",
    "ensemble of smaller, less complex models. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any one feature or set of \n",
    "features, and encourages it to learn more robust, generalizable representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping is a technique that stops the training process when the validation loss stops improving, effectively preventing \n",
    "the model from overfitting to the training data. This is based on the intuition that the model will generalize better if it is \n",
    "stopped before it starts to memorize the training data too well.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques can be applied individually or in combination, depending on the specific problem and model architecture. \n",
    "By using regularization, we can prevent overfitting and create models that generalize better to new, unseen data."

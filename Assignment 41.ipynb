    "Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "Ans. The Filter method in feature selection is a technique that selects features based on their statistical\n",
    "properties, such as their correlation with the target variable or their variance. It works by calculating a score \n",
    "for each feature and ranking them based on their importance. Features that are deemed important are selected, while \n",
    "the others are discarded."

    "Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "Ans. The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it involves training a model and evaluating \n",
    "its performance on a validation set for each subset of features. This means that the performance of the model i\n",
    "used as the criterion for selecting features, rather than their statistical properties. The Wrapper method is\n",

    "Q3. What are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods?\n",
    "Ans. Embedded feature selection methods involve incorporating the feature selection process into the\n",

    "Ans. One of the drawbacks of using the Filter method is that it ignores the interactions between\n",

    "on the performance of the model, which can lead to suboptimal results."

    "Q5. In which situations would you prefer using the Filter method over the Wrapper method for feature selection?\n",
    "Ans. The Filter method is often preferred over the Wrapper method in situations where the dataset\n",
    "is large and the number of features is high. This is because the Filter method is computationally efficient\n",
    "and can handle a large number of features without requiring multiple model training iterations."

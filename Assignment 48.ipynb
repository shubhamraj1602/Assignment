    "Q1. Explain the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. Provide an example of each.\n",
    "Ans. Simple linear regression and multiple linear regression are two types of linear regression models used in predictive\n",
    "analytics and machine learning. The key difference between the two is the number of predictor variables used to predict the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a linear model that uses only one predictor variable to predict the response variable. It assumes \n",
    "that there is a linear relationship between the predictor variable and the response variable. For example, a simple linear\n",
    "regression model can be used to predict the weight of a person based on their height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple linear regression, on the other hand, is a linear model that uses multiple predictor variables to predict the response \n",
    "variable. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the combination of the predictor variables and the response variable.\n",
    "For example, a multiple linear regression model can be used to predict the price of a house based on its location, size, number of\n",
    "bedrooms, and other relevant factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the difference between the two, let's consider an example. Suppose we want to predict the sales of a product based\n",
    "on the price. If we use only price as the predictor variable, we can use a simple linear regression model. However, if we want to \n",
    "include other variables such as advertising expenditure, seasonality, and competitor prices, we need to use a multiple linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, simple linear regression uses one predictor variable to predict the response variable, while multiple linear regression\n",

    "Q2. Discuss the assumptions of linear regression. How can you check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset?\n",
    "Ans. Linear regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable, \n",
    "that the errors or residuals are normally distributed and have constant variance, that there is little or no multicollinearity\n",
    "among the independent variables, and that the errors are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions of linear regression can be checked using various methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: A scatter plot of the independent variable(s) against the dependent variable can be used to visualize the linearity \n",
    "assumption. If the relationship appears to be non-linear, then a transformation of one or both variables may be needed.\n",
    "Normality: A histogram of the residuals can be used to check if they are normally distributed. Alternatively, a normal probability \n",
    "plot can be used to check for deviations from normality.\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: A plot of the residuals against the predicted values can be used to check for constant variance. If the variance \n",
    "appears to change with the predicted values, then this assumption is violated.\n",
    "Multicollinearity: Correlation matrix or scatter plot matrix can be used to check for multicollinearity. If two or more independent \n",
    "variables are highly correlated, then they may need to be combined or one of them may need to be dropped from the model.\n",
    "Independence: Residuals can be checked for independence using a plot of residuals against the order in which they were observed.\n",
    "If there is a pattern in the residuals, such as cycles or trends, then this assumption may be violated.\n",
    "If any of these assumptions are violated, then the linear regression model may not be appropriate for the data and additional \n",
    "steps may need to be taken to address the issue, such as transformation of variables, removal of outliers, or using a different \n",

    "Q3. How do you interpret the slope and intercept in a linear regression model? Provide an example using a real-world scenario.\n",
    "Ans. In a linear regression model, the slope represents the rate of change in the dependent variable for a unit\n",
    "increase in the independent variable. The intercept represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience. We build a linear \n",

    "of each update is controlled by the learning rate, which determines how quickly the algorithm converges to the minimum.\n",

    "There are two main types of gradient descent: batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. In batch gradient descent,\n",

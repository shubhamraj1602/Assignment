    "Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it represent?\n",
    "Ans. R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that\n",
    "can be explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. It is also known as the coefficient of determination.\n",
    "R-squared values range from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better fit between the observed data and the fitted model.\n",
    "R-squared is calculated as the ratio of the explained variance to the total variance, expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Define adjusted R-squared and explain how it differs from the regular R-squared.\n",
    "Ans. Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that takes into account the number of independent variables\n",
    "in the model. It is a more accurate measure of the goodness of fit for a regression model with multiple independent variables.\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared penalizes the inclusion of unnecessary independent variables that do not improve the model's performance. It \n",
    "is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R2 = 1 - [(1 - R2) * (n - 1) / (n - k - 1)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where n is the sample size, and k is the number of independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. When is it more appropriate to use adjusted R-squared?\n",
    "Ans. Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate to use when comparing models with different numbers of independent variables.\n",
    "It penalizes models that include unnecessary variables, which can result in a higher R-squared value even if the model is overfitting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are RMSE, MSE, and MAE in the context of regression analysis? How are these metrics calculated, and what do they represent?\n",
    "Ans. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) are metrics used to evaluate the performance\n",
    "of regression models. RMSE is the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. MSE is\n",
    "the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. MAE is the average of the absolute differences between\n",
    "the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE = sqrt(sum((y_pred - y_true)^2) / n)\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE = sum((y_pred - y_true)^2) / n\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE = sum(abs(y_pred - y_true)) / n\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using RMSE, MSE, and MAE as evaluation metrics in regression analysis.\n",
    "Ans. The advantages of using RMSE, MSE, and MAE as evaluation metrics in regression analysis are that they are easy to interpret,\n",
    "widely used, and provide a quantitative measure of the model's accuracy. However, they do not provide any information about the \n",
    "direction or nature of the error, and they do not distinguish between overfitting and underfitting. Additionally, RMSE and MSE are\n",
    "more sensitive to outliers than MAE, which can make them less robust in some cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explain the concept of Lasso regularization. How does it differ from Ridge regularization, and when is it more appropriate to use?\n",
    "Ans.  Lasso regularization is a technique used in linear regression to add a penalty term to the cost function that the model\n",
    "tries to minimize during training. This penalty term is the absolute value of the sum of the coefficients of the model, multiplied\n",
    "by a hyperparameter alpha, which determines the strength of the regularization. Lasso differs from Ridge regularization in that \n",
    "it tries to force some of the coefficients of the model to be exactly equal to zero, effectively performing feature selection. \n",
    "Ridge regularization, on the other hand, only shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but never makes them exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regularization is more appropriate to use when the dataset has many features, some of which are not important for making\n",
    "predictions. By setting some of the coefficients to zero, Lasso can effectively remove those features from the model, leading\n",
    "to a simpler and more interpretable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. How do regularized linear models help to prevent overfitting in machine learning? Provide an example to illustrate.\n",
    "Ans. Regularized linear models help prevent overfitting in machine learning by adding a penalty term to the cost function \n",
    "that the model tries to minimize during training. This penalty term encourages the model to have smaller and more evenly\n",
    "distributed coefficients, which in turn can help prevent over-reliance on a small subset of features in the dataset. For example, \n",
    "if we have a linear regression model with many features, some of which are highly correlated, the model may overfit and place too\n",
    "much weight on those features, leading to poor performance on new data. By adding a regularization term to the cost function, \n",
    "we can encourage the model to consider all features more equally, leading to a better fit on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Discuss the limitations of regularized linear models and explain why they may not always be the best choice for regression analysis.\n",
    "Ans. The limitations of regularized linear models include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice of hyperparameters: Regularized linear models require the choice of hyperparameters, such as alpha in Lasso or \n",
    "Ridge regularization. Choosing the optimal hyperparameters can be difficult and time-consuming, and may require cross-validation or other techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss of interpretability: Regularization can lead to some of the coefficients of the model being set to zero, effectively removing\n",
    "some features from the model. This can make the model less interpretable, as it may be unclear which features are important for making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited applicability: Regularized linear models are best suited for datasets with many features, some of which may be irrelevant \n",
    "or highly correlated. For datasets with fewer features or where all features are important, regularized linear models may not be the best choice.\n",
    "Q9. You are comparing the performance of two regression models using different evaluation metrics. Model A has an RMSE of 10,\n",
    "while Model B has an MAE of 8. Which model would you choose as the better performer, and why? Are there any limitations to your choice of metric?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The choice of which model is better depends on the specific problem and the importance of different types of errors.\n",
    "RMSE is a measure of the average size of the errors made by the model, while MAE is a measure of the average absolute size of \n",
    "the errors. In general, if we care more about larger errors, we might choose RMSE, while if we care more about smaller errors, \n",
    "we might choose MAE. However, it is important to note that both metrics have limitations, and should be used in conjunction with\n",
    "other evaluation metrics and domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. You are comparing the performance of two regularized linear models using different types of regularization. Model A uses\n",
    "Ridge regularization with a regularization parameter of 0.1, while Model Buses Lasso regularization with a regularization\n",
    "parameter of 0.5. Which model would you choose as thebetter performer, and why? Are there any trade-offs or limitations to \n",
    "your choice of regularization method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The choice of which model is better depends on the specific problem and the importance of different types of errors. \n",
    "Ridge regularization and Lasso regularization have different strengths and weaknesses. Ridge regularization is better suited for \n",
    "datasets where all features are important, and we want to shrink all of the coefficients towards zero. Lasso regularization is\n",
    "better suited for datasets with many features, some of which are not important, and we want to set some of the coefficients to exactly \n",
    "zero, effectively performing feature selection. The choice between the two depends on the specific problem and the importance of \n",
    "interpretability versus predictive performance. However, it is important to note that both regularization methods have limitations, \n",
    "and should be used in conjunction with other techniques such as cross-validation and domain knowledge."

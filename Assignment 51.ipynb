    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "Ans. Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression technique that performs both variable selection and regularization\n",
    "to prevent overfitting. It differs from other regression techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Ridge Regression \n",
    "by adding a penalty term to the sum of squared residuals. The penalty term is the absolute value of the coefficients multiplied \n",
    "by a tuning parameter (lambda). This penalty term shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero and can result in some coefficients\n",
    "being exactly equal to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "Ans. The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it can automatically select relevant\n",
    "features from a large set of variables. Lasso Regression tends to set the coefficients of the least important variables\n",
    "to zero, effectively removing them from the model. This can lead to a simpler and more interpretable model that is less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "Ans. The coefficients of a Lasso Regression model can be interpreted in a similar way to coefficients in other\n",
    "regression models. A positive coefficient indicates that the response variable is likely to increase with an increase\n",
    "in the corresponding independent variable, while a negative coefficient indicates that the response variable is likely \n",
    "to decrease with an increase in the corresponding independent variable. The magnitude of the coefficient represents the\n",
    "strength of the relationship between the independent variable and the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect themodel's performance?\n",
    "Ans. The tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is lambda, which controls the strength of the penalty term. A larger value\n",
    "of lambda results in greater shrinkage of the coefficient estimates and more feature selection. A smaller value of lambda\n",
    "allows more flexibility in the model and can lead to overfitting. The optimal value of lambda can be selected using techniques\n",
    "such as cross-validation or grid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "Ans. Yes, Lasso Regression can be used for non-linear regression problems by including non-linear transformations\n",
    "of the input features, such as polynomial or interaction terms, in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n",
    "Ans. The main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression is the penalty term used to regularize\n",
    "the coefficients. Ridge Regression uses a penalty term based on the squared value of the coefficients, while Lasso\n",
    "Regression uses a penalty term based on the absolute value of the coefficients. As a result, Lasso Regression tends to produce\n",
    "sparse models with some coefficients exactly equal to zero, effectively performing feature selection, while Ridge Regression\n",
    "tends to shrink all coefficients towards zero without necessarily setting any coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?\n",
    "Ans. Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features by selecting one of the correlated features \n",
    "and setting the coefficients of the others to zero. However, if two or more features are highly correlated, Lasso Regression\n",
    "may arbitrarily select one of them and set the others to zero, which can lead to instability in the model. This can be addressed \n",
    "by using a variant of Lasso Regression called Elastic Net Regression, which combines Lasso and Ridge Regression to handle\n",
    "multicollinearity more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?\n",
    "Ans. The optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression can be selected using techniques \n",
    "such as cross-validation or grid search. Cross-validation involves dividing the data into training and validation sets\n",
    "and testing the model with different values of lambda. The value of lambda that produces the best performance on the validation\n",
    "set is selected as the optimal value. Grid search involves testing the model with a predefined range of lambda values and \n",
    "selecting the value that produces the best performance on a validation set."

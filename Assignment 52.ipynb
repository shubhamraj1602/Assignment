    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "Ans. Elastic Net Regression is a regularization technique that combines the penalties of Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. \n",
    "It addresses the limitations of these two techniques by offering a balance between them. The regularization term in Elastic Net \n",
    "Regression is a combination of the L1 and L2 norms of the coefficients, which enables it to handle both multicollinearity and\n",
    "sparsity in the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Ans. The optimal values of the regularization parameters, alpha and l1_ratio, can be chosen using cross-validation. \n",
    "Grid search or randomized search can be used to explore a range of values for alpha and l1_ratio and find the combination that \n",
    "results in the best model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Ans. Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is capable of handling multicollinearity and sparsity in the input features.\n",
    "It is a more robust method compared to Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression when the dataset has both large numbers of \n",
    "features and small sample sizes.\n",
    "It provides a balance between the L1 and L2 regularization, which enables it to select important features while shrinking the\n",
    "coefficients of less important features.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression can be computationally expensive, especially when there are many input features.\n",
    "The choice of regularization parameters can affect the model's performance, and it can be difficult to find the optimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are some common use cases for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Ans. Elastic Net Regression is commonly used in situations where the input features are highly correlated and there is a need \n",
    "to identify the most important features while accounting for the correlations. It can also be used in situations where the sample\n",
    "size is small relative to the number of features, as it can help to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How do you interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Ans. The coefficients in Elastic Net Regression represent the strength and direction of the relationship between each \n",
    "input feature and the target variable. The magnitude of the coefficients reflects the importance of each feature in the model.\n",
    "Positive coefficients indicate a positive relationship between the feature and the target variable, while negative coefficients \n",
    "indicate a negative relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. How do you handle missing values when using Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Ans. Missing values can be handled by imputing them with a suitable value before training the Elastic Net Regression model. One common \n",
    "method is to use the mean or median value of the feature to replace the missing values. Another method is to use more advanced \n",
    "imputation techniques, such as K-nearest neighbors or regression imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. How do you use Elastic Net Regression for feature selection?\n",
    "Ans. Elastic Net Regression can be used for feature selection by setting the regularization parameter alpha to a high value, which will \n",
    "force some of the coefficients to be zero. The resulting model will only include the input features with non-zero coefficients, \n",
    "which correspond to the most important features in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How do you pickle and unpickle a trained Elastic Net Regression model in Python?\n",
    "Ans. In Python, you can pickle and unpickle a trained Elastic Net Regression model using the pickle module. Here is an example code:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pickle\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train and save the model\n",
    "model = ElasticNet()\n",
    "model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as f:\n",
    "    pickle.dump(model, f)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the saved model\n",
    "with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:\n",
    "    model = pickle.load(f)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q9. What is the purpose of pickling a model in machine learning?\n",
    "Ans. Pickling a model allows you to save a trained model as a binary file, which can be easily loaded later to make predictions"

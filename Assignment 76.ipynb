    "\n",
    "Ans. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra that are closely related to the eigen-decomposition approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a square matrix A, an eigenvector is a non-zero vector v such that when A is multiplied by v, the resulting vector is a\n",
    "scalar multiple of v. The scalar multiple is called the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, for a matrix A and an eigenvector v, the relationship is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "A * v = λ * v\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, A is the matrix, v is the eigenvector, and λ (lambda) is the eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigen-decomposition approach involves decomposing a matrix A into a product of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "A = V * Λ * V^(-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this decomposition, V is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A, Λ is a diagonal matrix with the corresponding eigenvalues\n",
    "of A, and V^(-1) is the inverse of matrix V.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decomposition allows us to express a matrix A in terms of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It provides valuable insights into the\n",
    "behavior and properties of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a 2x2 matrix A:\n",
    "\n",
    "A = [[3, 2],\n",
    "[1, 4]]\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we solve the equation (A - λI) * v = 0, where I is the identity matrix.\n",

    "Setting the determinant of (A - λI) to zero, we can solve for the eigenvalues:\n",
    "\n",
    "det(A - λI) = (3-λ)(4-λ) - 21 = λ^2 - 7λ + 10 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the quadratic equation, we find the eigenvalues as λ1 = 5 and λ2 = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting these eigenvalues back into (A - λI) * v = 0, we can solve for the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue:\n",
    "\n",
    "For λ1 = 5: We have (A - 5I) * v1 = 0, which gives the eigenvector v1 = [1, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "For λ2 = 2: We have (A - 2I) * v2 = 0, which gives the eigenvector v2 = [-2, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the eigen-decomposition of matrix A is:\n",

    "Q5. How do you find the eigenvalues of a matrix and what do they represent?\n",
    "Ans. Finding eigenvalues of a matrix and their representation:\n",
    "To find the eigenvalues of a matrix, we need to solve the characteristic equation. For an n x n matrix A, the characteristic\n",
    "equation is given by |A - λI| = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue, A is the matrix, and I is the identity matrix of size n x n.\n",
